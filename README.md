🏛️ Indian Education Exam Cell (IEEC)An AI-driven Automated Question Paper Generation System (AQPGS) built on Bloom’s Taxonomy and Cognitive Load Theory. IEEC allows educational institutions to generate standardized, high-integrity exam papers from K-12 to Post-Graduation (B.Tech/M.Tech) and Government Service Exams.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureThe system is architected as a multi-tenant platform where Authorities (Schools/Colleges) act as data providers, and the Chief Exam Cell Officer acts as the central processing authority.1. The Core AI Algorithm (Bloom's Integration)The system doesn't just pick questions; it solves a constrained optimization problem.Objective Function:To generate a paper $P$ such that the distribution of marks across Cognitive Levels ($L$) matches the target distribution $D$.$$TargetMarks(L_i) = \text{Total Marks} (M) \times \text{Weightage} (W_i)$$Selection Logic:For every section $S$ in the template:Filter: $\text{Candidates} = \{Q \in \text{QuestionBank} \mid Q_{subject} = S_{subject}, Q_{marks} = S_{req\_marks}, Q_{used} = \text{False}\}$Cognitive Check: Filter $\text{Candidates}$ further based on required $L_i$ (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating).Randomized Sampling: To prevent paper repetition:$$Q_{selected} = \text{random}(\text{Candidates})$$🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for real-time dashboard updates.AI Engine: Gemini 1.5 Flash / Pro via Google Genkit (for Syllabus parsing and Question mapping).Backend/Database: PostgreSQL (for Question Bank) & Supabase (for Syllabus PDF storage).Export Engine: docx-js for generating Government-standard .docx templates.👔 Administrative WorkflowChief Exam Cell Officer (Super Admin)Primary Identity: dk3624897@gmail.comAccess Level: Full CRUD on all registered organizations.Generation Control: The only authority capable of triggering the POST /api/generate-paper endpoint.Authority Registration & LoginEntity TypeRequirementsData InputSchoolOfficial .edu / .gov EmailClass 1-12, Stream (Science/Arts/Comm)College/UniOfficial Domain EmailGraduation / Post-Graduation SubjectsB.Tech/M.TechAICTE/UGC CredentialsBranch-specific Syllabus & NotesGovt BodyNIC / Gov EmailCompetitive Exam Syllabus📂 System Modules1. Registration & DashboardAuthorities register their details. Upon login, they access a Syllabus Vault.Action: Authorities upload PDF/Docx of Syllabus and Lecture Notes.Trigger: On upload, a notification is dispatched to the Chief Officer and an email is sent to dk3624897@gmail.com.2. The Generation EngineWhen the Chief Officer initiates generation:Syllabus Parsing: AI extracts key topics and Learning Outcomes (COs).Template Selection: Matches CBSE/University format.Algorithmic Selection: Iterates through the Question Bank using the Bloom's Taxonomy logic.DOCX Rendering: Produces a well-formatted document with Header Logos and standard instructions.3. DistributionGenerated papers are automatically pushed to the specific Authority Dashboard under the Exam Cell Section.🚀 Installation & DeploymentBash# Clone the repository
